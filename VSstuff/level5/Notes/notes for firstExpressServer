First thing to do: run "npm init -y" in terminal
Then, npm install <dependencies> , such as : express 
Next, make sure the main file is called the same as the main file in package.json.
    In this case, it's called "server.js"


Nodemon:
to install: npm install -g nodemon
The -g means we're only installing globally


arguments for "listen": 1: PORT 2: call-back function
to run the server, type "nodemon (or node) server.js" into the terminal (server.js is whatever name you call it, like theCatCosmo.js could be a server.)

Vocabulary:
    Route: listens for requests specific to the endpoint
        Similar to an event listener for http requests

        argument 1 is the endpoint. "/"
        argument 2 is a call back function (req, res)
        app.get("/", (req (request), res (response)) => {
        })

        route types:
        app.get()
        app.put()
        app.post()
        app.delete()

    Endpoint: Part of the URL
        AKA - mount path
        "/item" "/user"  

    Port: Keep the port number above 3000 but below 9000 (any number between 3001 and 9000)
        In the browser, you can type "localhost:9000/" to get to the server
