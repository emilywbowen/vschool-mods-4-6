In JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), the secret code acts like a secret key that scrambles information to create a secure token. Here's how it works:

User Object and Claims: Imagine you have information about a user, like their username and ID, stored in a user Object. This Object, along with other details you want to include (called claims), is like the ingredients for a recipe.

Secret Key: The secret code is a long, random string of characters known only to the server. This acts like your secret spice mix in the recipe.

Mixing it up: The server uses a special algorithm (like a mixing tool) to combine the user Object (ingredients) with the secret code (spice mix). This process creates a unique signature that proves the token came from the server and hasn't been tampered with.

The JWT Token: The final product is the JWT token, which is a combination of three parts: the user information (claims), the signature (created with the secret key), and some technical details about the algorithm used. It's like the finished dish with a unique flavor that identifies its orgins.

Here's the key takeaway: The secret code itself isn't directly included in the JWT. It's used behind the scenes by the server to create a special signature that verifies the token's authenticity. It's like a secret handshake between the server and the user that proves the user is who they claim to be.
