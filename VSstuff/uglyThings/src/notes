Need:
- Must have 3 input fields:
    - Img url field (A url to an image of an ugly thing)
    - Title field (The title of the image that the user wants to give)
    - Description field (why the user thinks it is ugly)
- Must have *Submit* button that submits the data
- Must display a list of posted images with their associated titles and descriptions
- Must store the array of ugly thing objects in the Context store
- Must be able to delete an ugly thing
- Must be able to edit an ugly thing
- Must make all requests via the [Ugly Things API](https://coursework.vschool.io/ugly-things-api-documentation/)

api to use: https://api.vschool.io/emilywbowen/thing


Components: 
SubButt - function that handles the submit button ******don't need b/c butt is on form*****
Thing - function that returns the entries
UglyForm - function that holds the input fields for a form
    needs 3 input fields: title, imgUrl, and description (must be cased and written as such for correct data transfer)
    I think this is also where the submit button with SubButt context would go
    Need edit and delete options (look back at meme generator?)
        Do I need a component similar to SubButt to handle the edit and delete?
uglyThingData - where the data is stored (do I need this?)
ContextProvider - provides the context, duh
